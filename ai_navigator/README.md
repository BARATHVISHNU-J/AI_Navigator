# 🧠 AI Navigator

**AI Navigator** is an interactive Django web application designed to visually demonstrate and compare pathfinding algorithms such as **A*** and **Dijkstra's**. It serves as both an educational tool and a fully functional game platform where users can create custom maze environments and observe real-time algorithmic decision-making.

## 🔄 Project Overview

AI Navigator enables users to:
- Create and customize game grids
- Place start/end points and obstacles
- Visualize pathfinding in real-time
- Track game statistics and performance

The system supports:
- User authentication and profile tracking
- Admin dashboard with analytics and user management
- Light/Dark mode toggling
- PostgreSQL database integration via Django ORM

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✨ **Interactive Grid Editor**: Drag, drop, and edit cells to simulate different maze configurations.
- 🧰 **Pathfinding Visualization**: Step-by-step animation of A* and Dijkstra's algorithm in action.
- 👤 **User Profiles**: Track game history, preferred algorithms, fastest time, and more.
- 📈 **Admin Analytics**: View user data, game stats, and system logs in a robust admin interface.
- 🔖 **Theme Toggling**: Seamless switch between light and dark modes.

## 🔄 Algorithms Implemented

### ⭐ A* Algorithm
- Uses heuristic (e.g., Manhattan distance) + path cost
- Efficient for optimal and shortest path in weighted graphs

### ♻️ Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Guarantees shortest path
- Explores all nodes based on path cost alone

---
